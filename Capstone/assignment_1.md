# Wasteland Runners

A post-apocalyptic text-based cooperative discord game where players (called Runners) have the chance to earn $SCRAP (currency) on each expedition. each expedition is on a schedule (cron job via Tuk Tuk), and Runners vote on three options as a group. they can discuss their strategy in discord for one minute each time, and have multiple risk-reward opportunities to earn $SCRAP as a team.

---

## Core Value Proposition and PMF

**Wasteland Runners** takes advantage of the prevalence of Discord within crypto-native communities and turns people's natural behavior to socialize on the platform into a cooperative play-2-earn environment. A combination of easily accessible earning (not skill-based or requiring expensive equipment or even using a web browser to open up a front-end app) and emergent community storytelling based on the actions they take in-game creates a low-stakes way to effectively "mine" $SCRAP with "proof-of-gaming", i.e just play the game, have fun with your friends, and earn some tokens — all on discord.

While building on Discord does create platform dependency risk — API limits and restrictions will have to be monitored and adhered to — Discord has actually been crypto-friendly so far and hasn't shown signs of becoming anti-crypto. The cooperative element works because crypto is inherently more social and community oriented than critics assume. Crypto-natives love to trade together, build together, and meme together. I've both received and given help in many ways without any expectation of a return or profit.

### Product Market Fit

**Wasteland Runners** leverages already existing Discord infrastructure and social communities, and leans into the community-building that already exists on Discord within the crypto-sphere. While the p2e market has been saturated in the past and plagued with questionable VC unlocks, shady teams, and unsustainable token economics, **Wasteland Runners** would be purely "game-2-mine", meaning that the entire token supply would be fairly earned by playing the game — no VCs, no insiders, no scumbags.

The p2e market is oversaturated, or has been. There hasn't been a good one to come out for a while, so I do think people would enjoy another run at it with a unique spin. For the purposes of this POC and accomplishing the task within the time limit, I stay away from complex economic systems that could absorb the game-to-mine inflation. There could be ways of tackling this in a real project — using $SCRAP to pay for runs or items that give you a better chance at X or Y task (further incentivizing groups to form around skills + item sets to successfully maximize their runs), and token burns, and other types of token sinks.

## Competitive Analysis

### Combined List:

**Pixels** - A blockchain-based social game on the Ronin blockchain. Lots of skills and skill-trees. Nfts, item rarity, and so on. There are VIP paid upgrades for add-ons. Players are bottle-necked by "energy", that is used up by every action taken. Social game but no resources are shared. You can cook, farm, make wine, and craft things. The game doesn't use Discord for core mechanics but it uses a webhook for players to socialize on Discord. They can also see the results of basic actions like dice rolls from the web app game.

**Gunz** - a blockchain gaming platform that uses Discord as a community hub of sorts and getting free items. No game mechanics use Discord itself.

**Idle Champions (Discord Integration)**: RPG-style Discord bot with earning mechanics, but requires complex character management and lacks cooperative decision-making. **Weakness**: High complexity barrier, no fair token distribution, individual rather than community-focused gameplay.

**Coin Hunt World**: Location-based crypto earning game with social elements. **Weakness**: Requires mobile app and physical movement, not Discord-native, limited social cooperation mechanics.

**Axie Infinity Origins**: Simplified from original Axie, but still requires NFT ownership and individual skill-based gameplay. **Weakness**: High entry costs, not social/cooperative, VC-backed with traditional tokenomics that target market distrusts.

### Platform & Indirect Competitors:

**Discord Gaming Bots** (Carl-bot, MEE6 gaming modules): Provide community engagement but no earning mechanics. **Threat Level: Medium** - easier to implement but no economic incentive.

**Crypto Faucets/Airdrops**: Easy earning opportunities that target similar "free crypto" desires. **Threat Level: Medium** - directly competes for attention of users seeking low-effort earning.

**Traditional Mining**: Ravencoin, Vertcoin, etc. still appeal to OG crypto-anarchist segment. **Threat Level: Medium** - different activity but competes for "fair earning" mindset.

**Social Media Gaming Platforms**: TikTok challenges, Discord activities, and Twitter spaces all appeal to different aspects of social attention, and they all require minimal effort to be a part of. My game is similar in its effort level, but it does take a bit more engagement to play with others, vote on outcomes, and form groups if desired. Also none of the activities mentioned are games. Traditional discord engagement tools are complementary, not adversarial to Wasteland Runners. The project discord would host the game, not other communities, so mods and discord owners don't need to worry about Discord policies.

### Founder Market Fit

**Deep Gaming DNA Meets Crypto-Native Experience**

I sit at the intersection of old-school gaming culture and crypto-native heritage. My formative gaming experiences in text-based RPGs like Fallout and Planescape: Torment directly inform my apocalyptic, narrative-driven cooperative gameplay and aesthetic that defines **Wasteland Runners.** I'm not just building a random crypto game I thought of last week, I'm building a game in a genre I've been steeped in for decades, for a crypto community I've lived and breathed since 2017.

**Execution**

My time in the space has spanned free hackathon (Solana Sandstorm) submissions like Bonk Buddy, where I built an international community with over 1500 members from nothing but a free mint and some BONK and SOL prize pools. I've worked at OlympusDAO, and contributed pixel art and animations as a member of the Hot Heads core team. I know what it's like to build a project from nothing, as well as join established projects that already have a vision and long-term goal.

Working at OlympusDAO was a bad tokenomic experiment, but it shows that I know what bad/runaway tokenomics looks like. 

On the subject of scope, Wasteland Runners isn't intended to be a massive operational project — I'm keeping the scope manageable and focused on the core Discord-native gaming experience rather than trying to build the next Axie Infinity or STEPN or DeFi Kingdoms.

**Market Access and Credibility**

My crypto network isn't large or exhaustive, but I am connected with a few well-known individuals in the space that I have known for years. I am not interested in VC money or raising funds. This project, if built in its entirety, would be a community-driven fair-launch project.

I don't have Discord technical expertise yet, and I'm not clear if I can build it either — that's exactly why I'm exploring this and learning through this capstone project! The goal is to understand the technical requirements and validate whether this is something I can execute on or if I need to find technical co-founders.

**A Natural Evolution**

After years of playing text-based RPGs and building crypto earning mechanics separately, Wasteland Runners represents the synthesis of everything I've learned - creating the first Discord-native, fair-launch, cooperative gaming experience that the crypto community deserves, built by someone who truly understands both the gaming culture and the cryptopunk ethos.

## PART A - Initial Definition & Research

**1. Core Value Proposition & Product-Market Fit (PMF)**

- **AI PROMPT**
    
    **"Wasteland Runners** - an apocalyptic-themed text-based cooperative discord game where players (called Runners) have the chance to earn $SCRAP (currency) on each expedition. each expedition is on a schedule (cron job via Tuk Tuk), and Runners vote on three options as a group. they can discuss their strategy in discord for one minute each time, and have multiple risk-reward opportunities to earn $SCRAP as a team."
    
    Based on my idea  help outline the core value proposition and initial thoughts on product-market fit. What are 2-3 key value areas?
    
    Looking at your Wasteland Runners concept, I'll analyze this through the strategic framework to develop a strong value proposition and assess market fit potential.
    
    ## Core Value Proposition & Product-Market Fit Analysis
    
    **Core Value Proposition**
    Wasteland Runners transforms Discord communities into cooperative earning environments by combining scheduled apocalyptic expeditions with real economic rewards, creating shared social experiences where strategic group decisions directly impact both narrative outcomes and financial gains for all participants.
    
    **Key Value Areas:**
    
    1. **Social Coordination Value**: The one-minute discussion windows and group voting mechanics create intense, time-pressured social experiences that build community bonds and shared investment in outcomes. This addresses Discord communities' need for structured, engaging activities beyond casual chat.
    2. **Accessible Earning Mechanics**: Text-based gameplay with scheduled expeditions allows users to participate in earning opportunities without requiring gaming skills, expensive hardware, or significant time investment - just strategic thinking and community participation during scheduled events.
    3. **Narrative-Driven Engagement**: The apocalyptic theme combined with cooperative risk-reward decisions creates ongoing storytelling where community choices shape both the game world and economic outcomes, providing both entertainment value and meaningful consequence to participation.
    
    **Product-Market Fit Assessment**: Moderate - The concept cleverly leverages existing Discord infrastructure and addresses real needs for community engagement and earning opportunities, but faces significant challenges around token economics sustainability and regulatory compliance in the crypto gaming space.
    
    **Critical Success Assumptions**:
    
    - Discord communities will consistently participate in scheduled events rather than treating them as novelties
    - $SCRAP token economics can be structured sustainably without becoming a Ponzi-like system requiring constant new user influx
    - The cooperative voting mechanics will create genuine strategic engagement rather than random clicking or single-player dominance
    
    The timing is interesting - there's growing fatigue with complex play-to-earn games, potentially creating space for simpler, more social approaches. However, the fundamental challenge of sustainable token economics in gaming remains largely unsolved industry-wide.

    ## Core Value Proposition and PMF
    
    **Wasteland Runners** takes advantage of the prevalence of Discord within crypto-native communities and turns people's natural behavior to socialize on the platform into a cooperative play-2-earn environment. A combination of easily accessible earning (not skill-based or requiring expensive equipment or even using a web browser to open up a front-end app) and emergent community storytelling based on the actions they take in-game creates a low-stakes way to effectively "mine" $SCRAP with "proof-of-gaming", i.e just play the game, have fun with your friends, and earn some tokens — all on discord.

        ## Target Market Identification
        
        Based on your value proposition emphasizing Discord-native crypto communities and fair token distribution, here are the key market segments:
        
        **Primary Target Segment:**
        
        - **Profile**: Crypto-native Discord community members aged 22-35, primarily male, with moderate disposable income ($40-80k annually). Active in multiple crypto Discord servers, understand tokenomics, and spend 2+ hours daily on Discord. Tech-savvy but gaming-casual, preferring social experiences over competitive skill-based games. Geographically distributed but concentrated in North America/Europe.
        - **Size Estimate**: ~500K-1M active users across established crypto Discord communities
        - **Value Alignment**: Already socializing on Discord in crypto contexts, understands token value, and frustrated with VC-dominated projects. Values community-driven experiences and fair token distribution.
        - **Acquisition Strategy**: Partner with established crypto Discord communities, leverage community managers, and use organic word-of-mouth through early adopter communities.
        
        **Secondary Target Segments:**
        
        1. **Discord Community Managers & Builders**: Server owners and moderators seeking engaging activities to increase member retention and activity. Values tools that build community cohesion while potentially generating revenue for their communities.
        2. **Fair Launch/Anti-VC Crypto Enthusiasts**: Users specifically seeking projects with equitable token distribution who are disillusioned with traditional crypto gaming ventures. Strong ideological alignment with "no VCs, no scumbags" messaging.
        3. **Social-First Gamers in Crypto**: Casual gamers who prefer cooperative over competitive experiences and are crypto-curious but intimidated by complex DeFi or high-skill gaming requirements. Drawn to low-barrier entry and social aspects.
        4. **International Discord Gaming Communities**: Non-English speaking crypto communities on Discord who may find earning opportunities more attractive due to currency arbitrage potential, particularly in emerging markets.
        
        **Segment Prioritization Rationale**: Primary segment has highest product-market fit with existing behavior patterns and infrastructure. Secondary segments represent natural expansion paths that leverage the same core value propositions while accessing different motivational drivers and community networks.
        
    - **Synthesized Paragraph**
        
        **Potential Target Markets**
        
        1. Crypto-native Discord community members. Active in multiple discords. Spends several hours a day on discord, doesn’t have time or interest for traditional gaming. Understands tokenomics, but has been burned by bad token mechanics, shady teams, or VC-dominated token allocations.
        2. Discord Community Managers & Builders. They already have access to communities and friends on discord, and are always on the lookout for earning opportunities for their communities.
        3. OG crypto-anarchists. They are fond of fair launches. Maybe they mined Ravencoin or Vertcoin on their graphics card back in the day. They probably own several Ordinals and have bitcointalk bookmarked.
        4. International gaming and crypto communities. p2e is especially popular in countries like the Phillipines.

        ## Competitive Landscape Analysis
        
        **Direct Competitors:**
        
        - **Idle Champions (Discord Integration)**: RPG-style Discord bot with earning mechanics, but requires complex character management and lacks cooperative decision-making. **Weakness**: High complexity barrier, no fair token distribution, individual rather than community-focused gameplay.
        - **Coin Hunt World**: Location-based crypto earning game with social elements. **Weakness**: Requires mobile app and physical movement, not Discord-native, limited social cooperation mechanics.
        - **Axie Infinity Origins**: Simplified from original Axie, but still requires NFT ownership and individual skill-based gameplay. **Weakness**: High entry costs, not social/cooperative, VC-backed with traditional tokenomics that target market distrusts.
        
        **Platform & Indirect Competitors:**
        
        - **Discord Gaming Bots** (Carl-bot, MEE6 gaming modules): Provide community engagement but no earning mechanics. **Threat Level: Medium** - easier to implement but no economic incentive.
        - **Crypto Faucets/Airdrops**: Easy earning opportunities that target similar "free crypto" desires. **Threat Level: High** - directly competes for attention of users seeking low-effort earning.
        - **Traditional Mining**: Ravencoin, Vertcoin, etc. still appeal to OG crypto-anarchist segment. **Threat Level: Medium** - different activity but competes for "fair earning" mindset.
        
        **Competitive Gaps Identified:**
        
        1. **Discord-Native Cooperative Earning**: No major competitor combines Discord-first design with group decision-making earning mechanics and fair token distribution.
        2. **Narrative-Driven Community Mining**: Existing earning opportunities lack storytelling elements that create shared community experiences and ongoing engagement.
        
        **Differentiation Opportunities:**
        
        - Position as "the only fair-launch Discord-native earning game" specifically targeting anti-VC sentiment
        - Emphasize cooperative over competitive mechanics to differentiate from skill-based P2E
        - Leverage scheduled expedition format to create appointment-based community engagement
        
        **Competitive Threats:**
        
        - **Discord Policy Changes**: Platform could restrict bot-based earning or crypto integration
        - **Established Gaming Projects Pivoting**: Larger projects could easily add Discord integration and cooperative mechanics
        - **Regulatory Crackdowns**: Gaming tokens face increasing scrutiny, especially earning-focused projects
        
        The biggest competitive advantage appears to be the intersection of fair-launch ideology with Discord-native social gaming - most competitors are either technically complex, VC-backed, or not truly community-cooperative.
        
    - **Manual Research**
        
        Pixels - A blockchain-based social game on the Ronin blockchain. Lots of skills and skill-trees. Nfts, item rarity, and so on. There are VIP paid upgrades for add-ons. Players are bottle-necked by “energy”, that is used up by every action taken. Social game but no resources are shared. You can cook, farm, make wine, and craft things. The game doesn’t use Discord for core mechanics but it uses a webhook for players to socialize on Discord. They can also see the results of basic actions like dice rolls from the web app game.

        **Output Analysis**
        
        The AI didn’t find any of the results that I manually found via google search. In general, I couldn’t find any game that actually uses discord as part of its core mechanics to send on-chain transactions. The discrepancies between AI and manual search are interesting but seems expected — there literally no game that uses Discord on the blockchain, so it picks up other uses of Discord with different kinds of integrations, usually using the Discord SDK.
        
    
3. **Founder-Market Fit (FMF)**
- Manual Write-up
    
    I have a long history of gaming since the late 90s onwards, getting lost in the worlds of text-based RPGs like Fallout and Planescape: Torment, point-and-click adventures like The Monkey Island series, and economic strategy games like Starcraft and Command and Conquer. My journey to crypto was natural — trading feels much like a game. Even more so once NFTs and GameFi took off.
    Over the years I’ve done various kinds of crypto work. With my small team, we created a Bonk-inspired project for the Solana Sandstorm hackathon (hosted by LamportDAO) called Bonk Buddy, in which we gave away 10,000 nfts that randomly earned SOL & USDC & BONK from a prize pool each week. I learned to design and animate pixel art, contributing to the Hot Heads project as a core team member. I worked on tokenomics and outreach for OlympusDAO as a team member when 3,3 was the hot thing. And now I work full-time in web3 for an institutional-only terminal product.
    My network is not large but well connected. I am good long-time friends with some well-known people in the space.

    Given my background, how might I frame my founder-market fit for this project idea -- "**Wasteland Runners**
    An apocalyptic-themed text-based cooperative discord game where players (called Runners) have the chance to earn $SCRAP (currency) on each expedition. each expedition is on a schedule (cron job via Tuk Tuk), and Runners vote on three options as a group. they can discuss their strategy in discord for one minute each time, and have multiple risk-reward opportunities to earn $SCRAP as a team."
    
    ## Founder-Market Fit Framing for Wasteland Runners
    
    **Deep Gaming DNA Meets Crypto-Native Experience**
    
    Your founder-market fit story is exceptionally strong because you represent the exact intersection of old-school gaming culture and crypto-native building that Wasteland Runners requires. Your formative gaming experiences in text-based RPGs like Fallout and Planescape: Torment directly inform the apocalyptic, narrative-driven cooperative gameplay that defines Wasteland Runners - you're not just building a game you understand, but one that emerged from decades of loving this exact genre.
    
    **Proven Crypto Project Execution**
    
    Your track record demonstrates the specific capabilities needed for this project: Bonk Buddy proves you can execute earning-based crypto projects with prize pools and tokenomics (directly relevant to $SCRAP distribution), while your OlympusDAO tokenomics experience shows you understand sustainable crypto-economic design. Your pixel art and creative contributions to Hot Heads demonstrate the aesthetic sensibilities needed for Discord-native gaming experiences, and your current institutional web3 work shows you understand the technical infrastructure required.
    
    **Market Access and Credibility**
    
    Your "small but well-connected" network in crypto is perfectly sized for a fair-launch, community-driven project - you're not a VC-backed insider but rather someone with authentic relationships in exactly the communities Wasteland Runners targets. Your friends in the space provide natural distribution channels into crypto-native Discord communities, while your hackathon and project experience gives you credibility with the anti-VC, builder-focused audience.
    
    **The Natural Evolution**
    
    Frame this as the logical next step in your journey: "After years of playing text-based RPGs and building crypto earning mechanics separately, Wasteland Runners represents the synthesis of everything I've learned - creating the Discord-native, fair-launch, cooperative gaming experience that the crypto community deserves, built by someone who truly understands both the gaming culture and the crypto ethos."
    
    This positions you not as someone pivoting into gaming, but as someone who's been preparing for this exact project for decades.

## PART B - Adversarial Analysis & Refinement

1. **Adversarial AI Task - Consolidation Value Prop/PMF, Target Markets, Competitors**
    - AI PROMPT
        
        Critique my project's value proposition, target market, and competitive analysis. Why might this not be a true blue ocean? What types of competitors might have been overlooked? // note: I attached the entire consolidated refined output into Claude.
        
        ## Adversarial Strategic Critique
        
        **Strategic Vulnerabilities:**
        
        1. **Platform Dependency Death Trap**: Your entire project lives or dies based on Discord's policies. They could ban crypto transactions, restrict bots, or change APIs overnight - killing your project instantly. Unlike web-based competitors who control their infrastructure, you're building on someone else's platform who has shown hostility to crypto activities before.
        2. **"Fair Launch" Economic Fantasy**: You're assuming token sustainability without VC backing, but every token needs ongoing demand generation. Who's buying $SCRAP after the initial buzz? Your "game-2-mine" model could easily become a classic Ponzi where later players fund earlier players unless there's genuine external economic demand - which you haven't identified.
        3. **Cooperative Gaming Assumption Flaw**: You assume people want to share earnings cooperatively, but crypto attracts individualistic profit-seekers. Your target market of crypto-native users might actually prefer individual earning over group dependency, especially when real money is involved.
        
        **Overlooked Competitive Threats:**
        
        - **Social Media Gaming Platforms**: TikTok challenges, Discord activities, and Twitter spaces already capture social gaming attention with zero crypto complexity
        - **Traditional Discord Engagement Tools**: Polls, events, and community features that server owners prefer because they don't risk platform violations
        - **Regulation-as-Competitor**: Government crackdowns on earning-based crypto gaming could kill the entire category before you launch
        
        **Market Reality Challenges:**
        
        - **Discord Crypto Fatigue**: Your target communities might be oversaturated with crypto projects and resistant to another earning scheme, no matter how "fair"
        - **International Market Assumption**: Just because P2E is popular in the Philippines doesn't mean Discord-based gaming will be - different platforms, different cultural preferences
        - **Community Manager Risk Aversion**: Server owners might avoid crypto earning activities to protect their communities from platform violations
        
        **Execution Risk Factors:**
        
        - **Technical Complexity Underestimation**: On-chain transactions through Discord bots involve complex infrastructure you haven't detailed, potentially requiring significant technical resources
        - **Community Management at Scale**: Coordinating timed voting across multiple Discord servers with different cultures and time zones could be operationally nightmarish
        
        **The Case Against This Project:**
        This looks like a solution searching for a problem - just because you can integrate blockchain with Discord doesn't mean you should. The platform risk alone makes this extremely fragile, and you're competing with entertainment options that don't require users to understand tokenomics or risk regulatory uncertainty.
        
        **Why This Might Not Be Blue Ocean:**
        The absence of Discord-native blockchain gaming might indicate market rejection rather than opportunity - Discord users might prefer their gaming and crypto activities separated for good reasons (simplicity, platform safety, community focus over profit).
        
    - Analysis of AI Critique
        1. Entire project lives on Discord. Yes, this is a definite risk. API limits and restrictions will have to monitored and adhered to, and there is a risk that Discord could become anti-crypto in the future. So far that has not been the case.
        2. Token sustainability. For the purposes of this POC and accomplishing the task within the time limit, I stay away from complex economic systems that could absorb the game-to-mine inflation. There could be ways of tackling this in a real project — using $SCRAP to pay for runs or items that give you a better chance at X or Y task (further incentivizing groups to form around skills + item sets to successfully maximize their runs), and token burns, and other types of token sinks. 
        3. Cooperative gaming. I think crypto is inherently more social and community oriented than the AI argues. I have both received and given help in many ways without any expectation of a return or profit. While growing your own portfolio is inherently individualistic, crypto people seek out engaging with others on twitter, discord, github, and so on. Crypto-natives love to trade together, build together, and meme together. 
        4. Competition. Tik tok/discord activities/twitter spaces all appeal to different aspects of social attention, and they all require minimal effort to be a part of. My game is similar in its effort level, but it does take a bit more engagement to play with others, vote on outcomes, and form groups if desired. Also none of the activities mentioned are gaming.
        
        Traditional discord engagement tools are complementary, not adversarial to Wasteland Runners. The project discord would host the game, not other communities, so mods and discord owners don’t need to worry about Discord policies.
        
        Regulation has only gotten more positive for crypto over the years, and very large and scammy p2e games have still not been prosecuted, so I doubt a tiny discord game would come under scrutiny.
        5. Oversaturation. The p2e market is oversaturated, or has been. There hasn’t been a good one to come out for a while, so I do think people would enjoy another run at it with a unique spin.
        6. International Market. I achieved great success with attracting an international market for a completely free game (Bonk Buddy), so I do believe international communities seek out p2e games more than US markets.
        7. Technical complexity. On-chain txs via discord bots, hooking up wallets, falling within Discord rate limits, running on-chain cron jobs, still need to be mapped out and solved for. I don’t think it requires “significant technical resources”, but yes it will require a lot of research and tinkering.
        8. Community management at scale. I don’t think coordination will be an issue. People will either be there to play as a group or the game begins with 1 or 2 players, or doesn’t begin — or some other condition takes effect. This will be workshopped.

        # Wasteland Runners
        
        An apocalyptic-themed text-based cooperative discord game where players (called Runners) have the chance to earn $SCRAP (currency) on each expedition. each expedition is on a schedule (cron job via Tuk Tuk), and Runners vote on three options as a group. they can discuss their strategy in discord for one minute each time, and have multiple risk-reward opportunities to earn $SCRAP as a team.
        
        ---
        
        ## Core Value Proposition and PMF
        
        **Wasteland Runners** takes advantage of the prevalence of Discord within crypto-native communities and turns people's natural behavior to socialize on the platform into a cooperative play-2-earn environment. A combination of easily accessible earning (not skill-based or requiring expensive equipment or even using a web browser to open up a front-end app) and emergent community storytelling based on the actions they take in-game creates a low-stakes way to effectively "mine" $SCRAP with "proof-of-gaming", i.e just play the game, have fun with your friends, and earn some tokens — all on discord.
        
        While building on Discord does create platform dependency risk — API limits and restrictions will have to be monitored and adhered to — Discord has actually been crypto-friendly so far and hasn't shown signs of becoming anti-crypto. The cooperative element works because crypto is inherently more social and community oriented than critics assume. Crypto-natives love to trade together, build together, and meme together. I've both received and given help in many ways without any expectation of a return or profit.
        
        ### Product Market Fit
        
        **Wasteland Runners** leverages already existing Discord infrastructure and social communities, and leans into the community-building that already exists on Discord within the crypto-sphere. While the p2e market has been saturated in the past and plagued with questionable VC unlocks, shady teams, and unsustainable token economics, **Wasteland Runners** would be purely "game-2-mine", meaning that the entire token supply would be fairly earned by playing the game — no VCs, no insiders, no scumbags.
        
        The p2e market is oversaturated, or has been. There hasn't been a good one to come out for a while, so I do think people would enjoy another run at it with a unique spin.

        ## Competitive Analysis
        
        ### Combined List:
        
        **Pixels** - A blockchain-based social game on the Ronin blockchain. Lots of skills and skill-trees. Nfts, item rarity, and so on. There are VIP paid upgrades for add-ons. Players are bottle-necked by "energy", that is used up by every action taken. Social game but no resources are shared. You can cook, farm, make wine, and craft things. The game doesn't use Discord for core mechanics but it uses a webhook for players to socialize on Discord. They can also see the results of basic actions like dice rolls from the web app game.
        
        **Gunz** - a blockchain gaming platform that uses Discord as a community hub of sorts and getting free items. No game mechanics use Discord itself.
        
        **Idle Champions (Discord Integration)**: RPG-style Discord bot with earning mechanics, but requires complex character management and lacks cooperative decision-making. **Weakness**: High complexity barrier, no fair token distribution, individual rather than community-focused gameplay.
        
        **Coin Hunt World**: Location-based crypto earning game with social elements. **Weakness**: Requires mobile app and physical movement, not Discord-native, limited social cooperation mechanics.
        
        **Axie Infinity Origins**: Simplified from original Axie, but still requires NFT ownership and individual skill-based gameplay. **Weakness**: High entry costs, not social/cooperative, VC-backed with traditional tokenomics that target market distrusts.
        
        ### Platform & Indirect Competitors:
        
        **Discord Gaming Bots** (Carl-bot, MEE6 gaming modules): Provide community engagement but no earning mechanics. **Threat Level: Medium** - easier to implement but no economic incentive.
        
        **Crypto Faucets/Airdrops**: Easy earning opportunities that target similar "free crypto" desires. **Threat Level: High** - directly competes for attention of users seeking low-effort earning.
        
        **Traditional Mining**: Ravencoin, Vertcoin, etc. still appeal to OG crypto-anarchist segment. **Threat Level: Medium** - different activity but competes for "fair earning" mindset.
        
        **Social Media Gaming Platforms**: TikTok challenges, Discord activities, and Twitter spaces all appeal to different aspects of social attention, and they all require minimal effort to be a part of. My game is similar in its effort level, but it does take a bit more engagement to play with others, vote on outcomes, and form groups if desired. Also none of the activities mentioned are gaming. Traditional discord engagement tools are complementary, not adversarial to Wasteland Runners. The project discord would host the game, not other communities, so mods and discord owners don't need to worry about Discord policies.

        ## Founder Market Fit
        
        **Deep Gaming DNA Meets Crypto-Native Experience**
        
        I sit at the intersection of old-school gaming culture and crypto-native heritage. My formative gaming experiences in text-based RPGs like Fallout and Planescape: Torment directly inform my apocalyptic, narrative-driven cooperative gameplay and aesthetic that defines **Wasteland Runners.** I'm not just building a random crypto game I thought of last week, I'm building a game in a genre I've been steeped in for decades, for a crypto community I've lived and breathed since 2017.
        
        **Execution**
        
        My time in the space has spanned free hackathon (Solana Sandstorm) submissions like Bonk Buddy, where I built an international community from nothing but a free mint and some BONK and SOL prize pools. I've worked at OlympusDAO, and contributed pixel art and animations as a member of the Hot Heads core team. I know what it's like to build a project from nothing, as well as join established projects that already have a vision and long-term goal.
        
        I achieved great success with attracting an international market for a completely free game (Bonk Buddy), so I do believe international communities seek out p2e games more than US markets. Community management coordination won't be an issue. People will either be there to play as a group or the game begins with 1 or 2 players, or doesn't begin — or some other condition takes effect. This will be workshopped.
        
        **Market Access and Credibility**
        
        My crypto network isn't large or exhaustive, but I am connected with a few well-known individuals in the space that I have known for years. I am not interested in VC money or raising funds. This project, if built in its entirety, would be a community-driven fair-launch project. Regulation has only gotten more positive for crypto over the years, and very large and scammy p2e games have still not been prosecuted, so I doubt a tiny discord game would come under scrutiny.
        
        **A Natural Evolution**
        
        After years of playing text-based RPGs and building crypto earning mechanics separately, Wasteland Runners represents the synthesis of everything I've learned - creating the first Discord-native, fair-launch, cooperative gaming experience that the crypto community deserves, built by someone who truly understands both the gaming culture and the cryptopunk ethos.
        
    - Reasoning for Changes
        
        I added a few thing that I responded to with the AI critique.
        
        1. I think its good to acknowledge the depending on Discord.
        2. Token economics and market saturation is an issue in gaming in general, so its worth addressing.
        3. Added social media competitors like discord activities, tik tok, and twitter is addressed.
        4. Addressed the idea of the market rejecting discord games hence why it doesnt exist.
        5. Highlighted my success with international markets with Bonk Buddy and the prevalence of p2e games abroad.
        6. Addressed regulatory concerns.

        Critique my founder-market fit. What makes it potentially weak? How could I strengthen my positioning?
        
        ## Founder-Market Fit Critique
        
        **Founder Strengths:**
        
        - **Authentic Domain Passion**: Your decades-long connection to text-based RPGs provides genuine product vision and aesthetic sensibility that can't be faked
        - **Crypto Community Credibility**: Multi-year experience across different crypto projects demonstrates staying power and real community connections rather than tourist behavior
        
        **Critical Gaps:**
        
        - **Technical Leadership Uncertainty**: You mention contributing pixel art and working on tokenomics, but it's unclear if you can actually build the Discord bot infrastructure and blockchain integration that Wasteland Runners requires. Are you the technical founder or do you need to find one?
        - **Scale Execution Missing**: All your examples (Bonk Buddy, Hot Heads contributions) seem relatively small-scale. Building a multi-server Discord gaming platform with sustainable tokenomics requires operational complexity you haven't demonstrated experience managing.
        
        **Execution Risks:**
        
        - **Platform-Specific Inexperience**: No mention of Discord bot development, API limitations, or platform policy navigation - critical skills for a Discord-native product that could be banned overnight.
        - **OlympusDAO Tokenomics Reference**: This might actually hurt your credibility since OlympusDAO's (3,3) mechanics ultimately failed and became a cautionary tale. Mentioning it highlights tokenomics experience but also association with unsustainable economic models.
        
        **Strengthening Recommendations:**
        
        1. **Demonstrate Discord Technical Competency**: Build and launch a simple Discord bot with basic game mechanics to prove platform execution capability before pitching the full vision.
        2. **Quantify Previous Success**: "International community from nothing" for Bonk Buddy is vague - provide concrete metrics (users, engagement, retention) to demonstrate community-building scale.
        
        **Founder-Market Fit Assessment**: Moderate - Strong cultural and aesthetic fit with authentic domain passion, but concerning gaps in technical leadership and scale execution that could prevent successful delivery of a complex Discord-blockchain integration project.
        
        **The Investor Concern**: You sound like someone who deeply understands what this game should feel like, but it's unclear whether you can actually build and scale it.
        
    - Analyze output
        
        Some thoughts on the output:
        
        1. For bonk buddy i created a community with over 1500 members.
        2. OlympusDao was a bad tokenomic experiment but it shows that i know what bad tokenomics is.
        3. Correct I don't have discord technical expertise.
        4. Correct I don't have experience with a massive project, this is not intended to be a massive operational project.
        5. Correct I'm also not sure if i can build it either! Hence why I’m exploring this and learning for this capstone project!

1. **My discord message and conceptual ideas:**
- **Wasteland Runners**
    
    - an apocalyptic-themed text-based cooperative discord game where you have the chance to earn $SCRAP (currency) on each expedition.
    
    each expedition is on a schedule and set up by a discord bot (and tuktuk by helium to automate on-chain programs) and up to 4/5/6(?) users can join a room. once it begins, gamers vote on a decision tree what group decision they would like to make and that gets executed and has verifiable random results (chance to fail, chance to pass, chance to earn small/medium/large caches of $SCRAP). gamers have one minute for each decision in the expedition, so as to encourage people to chat and cooperate on what they want to do.
    
    once an expedition is over (after 5 mins or so), any loot that is found is split amongst the team of runners. 
    
    the target market would be crypto gamers and discord crypto communities since so many people already naturally live here for different purposes. this game integrates naturally into something we already do without taking you outside to some website or interface that very few crypto people like to engage with anyway. the game also leverages the natural social aspect of discord and uses it as a game mechanic that translates to onchain actions.
    
    Wasteland Runners could eventually expand to use nfts for items, character representation, accomplishment badges, character state tracking, and other random things, but id rather begin with the simpler premise of "play cooperative game with friends and earn tokens -- all in discord".
    
    an example of a simple scenario below that represents just one action in the expedition (out of 4-6 the group makes in total before the game ends).
    
    ```
    💀 Scenario 3: The Humming Generator
    
    Your group discovers a pre-war generator still running in a basement, which is unfortunate, since things that continue working long after they should have stopped rarely do so for pleasant reasons. It hums with the sort of mechanical contentment that suggests it has been planning something for decades.
    
    A toolbox sits nearby, though "tools" in the wasteland often serve purposes their manufacturers never intended.
    
    Option A: Leave it alone because you are smart. (Safe, +0 $SCRAP, increased chance for $SCRAP later in the expedition)
    Option B: You are brave or incompetent or both. You attempt to salvage individual parts from the weird machine with the "tools" nearby. (70% chance +25 $SCRAP)
    Option C: YOLO. Attempt full disassembly (40% chance +60 $SCRAP, 60% electrocution)
    
    ```
