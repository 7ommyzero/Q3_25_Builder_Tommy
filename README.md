<summary><strong>Week 0 - Prerequisites</strong></summary>

Finished the pre-reqs to qualify for turbin3 cohort q3.
Used TS and Rust.

Some things I learned:
 - You are allowed to modify an IDL at the source!
 - I used a method to force the IDL instead -- there are multiple ways to solve a problem.
 - Airdropping
 - Minting NFTs
 - How to use authorities
 - I didn't know nothing about TS before this besides passively reading them for IDLs before.
