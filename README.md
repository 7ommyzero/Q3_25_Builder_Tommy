## TURBIN3 PROJECTS

<details>
<summary><strong>Week 0 - Prerequisites</strong></summary>

**Overview**: Finished the pre-reqs to qualify for turbin3 cohort q3. Used TS and Rust.

Some things I learned:
 - You are allowed to modify an IDL at the source!
 - I used a method to force the IDL instead -- there are multiple ways to solve a problem.
 - Airdropping
 - Minting NFTs
 - How to use authorities
 - I didn't know nothing about TS before this, besides passively reading IDLs for other projects.

<summary><strong>Week 1 - SPL Token, Gill, NFTs</strong></summary>

**Overview**: Day 1 - SPL tokens

Some things I learned:
 - How to go through the whole process to initialize a mint address then use it for creating metadata, minting the token and then tranferring it to another address.
 - I figured out a function to take in the decimal amount and make the token amounts more human-readable when modifing the values eg... toTokenAmount(50) / number_tokens(500) to correspond to the actual number of tokens you are sending.
