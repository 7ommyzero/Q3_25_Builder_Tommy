# Visual Flow of the `Purchase` Instruction

This document provides a high-level, text-based diagram illustrating the relationships between the key accounts in the `Purchase` instruction and the flow of assets during an NFT purchase transaction.

---

### **Diagram Key:**
-   `[ ACCOUNT ]` -> A primary account involved in the flow.
-   `-->` -> Shows a relationship or data flow.
-   `(PDA)` -> Indicates the account is a Program Derived Address.
-   `{ Action }` -> Denotes a critical operation or transfer.
-   `üí∞` -> SOL/Lamport transfers
-   `üñºÔ∏è` -> NFT transfers

### **Detailed Breakdown of Relationships**

1.  **Initiation:**
    *   The **`Taker`** (a `Signer`) initiates the purchase transaction.
    *   They must have enough SOL to cover the listing price.
    *   The system creates or verifies their **`Taker ATA`** for receiving the NFT.

2.  **SOL Distribution (`send_sol()`):**
    *   Calculates marketplace fee: `listing.price * marketplace.fee / 10000`
    *   **First Transfer:** `listing.price - fee` goes from `Taker` to `Maker`
    *   **Second Transfer:** `fee` goes from `Taker` to `Treasury`
    *   Both transfers use the System Program

3.  **NFT Transfer (`send_nft()`):**
    *   Uses **`Listing`** as the signing authority (PDA with seeds)
    *   Creates signer seeds: `[marketplace_key, maker_mint_key, listing.bump]`
    *   Transfers exactly 1 NFT from **`Vault`** to **`Taker ATA`**
    *   Uses `transfer_checked` for secure token transfer with decimal validation

4.  **Cleanup (`close_mint_vault()`):**
    *   Uses same PDA signing authority as NFT transfer
    *   Closes the **`Vault Account`** and sends remaining rent to **`Maker`**
    *   The **`Listing Account`** is also closed (specified in constraints) with rent going to **`Maker`**

5.  **Key Constraints & Security:**
    *   **`Vault`** authority is controlled by **`Listing`** PDA
    *   **`Listing`** can only be found with correct seeds (marketplace + maker_mint)
    *   **`Taker ATA`** is created if needed, ensuring proper token account setup
    *   **`Treasury`** receives marketplace fees automatically
    *   **`Rewards`** mint is included for potential future reward distribution

6.  **Required Programs:**
    *   **System Program:** For SOL transfers and account creation
    *   **Token Program:** For NFT transfers and vault closure
    *   **Associated Token Program:** For ATA creation and management

| Account | Before Purchase | After Purchase |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Taker** | Has SOL | SOL - listing.price |
| **Maker** | Waiting for sale | Receives SOL (price - fees) + rent refunds |
| **Treasury** | Accumulating fees | Receives marketplace fees |
| **Taker ATA** | Empty or non-existent | Contains 1 NFT |
| **Vault** | Contains 1 NFT | **CLOSED** |
| **Listing** | Active listing data | **CLOSED** |
| **Marketplace** | Facilitating trade | Collects fees via treasury |
